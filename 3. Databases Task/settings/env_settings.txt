# ------------------ Installing MySQL on Ubuntu ------------------

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install mysql-server

#Ensure that the server is running using the systemctl start command:
    sudo systemctl status mysql.service    
          sudo systemctl start mysql.service

#Check if MySQL was successfully installed by running:
    mysql --version

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Warning: As of July 2022, an error will occur when you run the mysql_secure_installation script without some 
# further configuration. The reason is that this script will attempt to set a password for the installation’s root
# MySQL account but, by default on Ubuntu installations, this account is not configured to connect using a
# password.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#First, open up the MySQL prompt:

    sudo mysql

#Then run the following ALTER USER command to change the root user’s authentication method to one that uses a password. 
#The following example changes the authentication method to mysql_native_password:

    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

#After making this change, exit the MySQL prompt:
    exit

#Following that, you can run the 
    mysql_secure_installation script without issue.

#Once the security script completes, you can then reopen MySQL and change the root user’s authentication method back to the default, auth_socket. 
#To authenticate as the root MySQL user using a password, run this command:
    mysql -u root -p

#Then go back to using the default authentication method using this command:
	ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;

#This will mean that you can once again connect to MySQL as your root user using the sudo mysql command.

#Run the security script with sudo:
    	sudo mysql_secure_installation

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#Verify that the MySQL server is running by running:
sudo systemctl status mysql

#Log in to MySQL Server
sudo mysql -u root
