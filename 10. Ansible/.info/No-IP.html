<h1 id="install-configure-noip"><a href="https://thanoskoutr.com/posts/noip2-install-and-service-commands/">Install &amp; Configure NoIP</a></h1>
<p>No-IP is a Free Dynamic DNS and Managed DNS Provider, that we can use to get a free domain name. There a lot of free Dynamic DNS services, you can find a good comprehensive of them here that we can choose from, but this was the first service that I personally tried.</p>
<p>The good with this service is that we have a big selection of free domain names that we can choose, so we can easily find a domain that is available for the hostname we want to have.</p>
<p>The negative is that every 30 days they send a notification email, and we have to sign in to www.noip.com and confirm that we still use the hostname. After some time that I have used the service, I can say that it becomes annoying to verify it once every month.</p>
